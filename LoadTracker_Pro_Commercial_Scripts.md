## VERSION 3: "Why We Built This" - Founder Story (2-3 minutes)

Let me tell you a story.

I own a trucking company. Not a huge operation, but we run good trucks, good drivers, and we take care of our customers.

A few years back, I was paying $700 a month for one of those big-name TMS systems. You know the ones. They promise everything, right?

But here's what they don't tell you.

You want load tracking? Sure, but that comes in the "Professional Package" with five other features you'll never use.

Need another feature? Sorry, that's in the "Enterprise Package." More money.

Got two dispatchers? Can't have them both logged in at the same time unless you pay for a second seat. Want three people working? Three seats. Ka-ching, ka-ching.

And the billing? Man, the billing was a nightmare. Every month it was a surprise. "Oh, you ran 47 loads this month instead of 45? Here's an extra charge." It was impossible to budget.

But the worst part? The absolute worst part was when I'd call support and say, "Hey, I really need this one specific thing for my operation," and they'd say, "Sure! We can add that to your custom package for just $200 more a monthâ€”plus you'll get these three other features!"

And I'd think... I don't need those three other features. I don't want them. I just need this ONE thing.

But that's how they operate. Bundle everything together, maximize profit, and if you don't like it? Well, there's the door.

So one day, I'd had enough.

I thought, "What if we built a TMS system the way a trucker would build it? What would that look like?"

It would be honest. One priceâ€”$249 a month. That's it.

It would have unlimited users. Because why should I pay extra for my own employees to do their jobs?

It would have real-time GPS tracking. Not "last known location from 3 hours ago when the driver happened to update." Real tracking. Every 30 seconds.

It would have automated invoicing that actually works with detention time proofâ€”GPS timestamps that hold up in billing disputes.

It would have a mobile portal that drivers can actually use. Big buttons. Simple screens. Not some clunky desktop interface crammed onto a phone.

It would have smart document management with OCRâ€”upload a rate con, and the system reads it. No typing.

It would have IFTA reporting built in, because every trucking company needs that.

And it would have a real-time usage dashboard so you always know exactly where you stand. No surprise bills.

That's what I wanted. So that's what we built.

LoadTracker Pro isn't built to maximize software company profits. It's built to help trucking companies run better without getting ripped off.

We give you everything the $700 systems haveâ€”for $249 a month with unlimited users.

No forced bundles. No per-seat charges. No surprises.

Just honest software built by someone who runs trucks and understands exactly what you're dealing with.

Because I'm not just the guy who built this software.

I'm the guy who got tired of overpaying for it.

$249 per month. Unlimited users. Everything you need.

Welcome to TMS software that's actually on your side.

## VERSION 4: Full Feature Commercial (8-10 minutes)

**LoadTracker Pro - Transportation Management Built By Truckers, For Truckers**

### **The Problem We Solved**

LoadTracker Pro was born out of frustration. Our founderâ€”a trucking company owner himselfâ€”was tired of paying $700 per month for bloated TMS systems that treated customers like ATM machines.

**The old way was broken:**
- Want one feature? Pay for a "package" with three other things you'll never use
- Need another feature? That's in a different packageâ€”more money
- Got two dispatchers? Can't both work at the same time unless you pay for a second "seat"
- Surprise billing every month based on load counts you couldn't predict
- Systems designed for profit, not for the people actually running trucks

**We said enough is enough.**

---

### **What Makes LoadTracker Pro Different**

**Simple, Transparent Pricing: $249/Month**
- Unlimited users - Your entire office can work simultaneously. No per-seat charges.
- Generous free tier - Plenty of loads, GPS tracking, and features included before you hit usage overages
- Clear overage pricing - You'll always know exactly what you're paying for
- No surprise bills - Real-time usage dashboard shows exactly where you stand

Compare that to $700 per month with nickel-and-dime charges for every little thing.

### **Every Feature You Actually Need (And Nothing You Don't)**

**Real-Time GPS Fleet Tracking**

This isn't some "last known location" system. This is real tracking.

Your drivers activate GPS tracking with one tap on their phone. No special hardware. No expensive tracking devices. Just their phone.

Every 30 seconds, their location updates automatically. You see exactly where every truck is on a live map.

Each truck marker shows the driver's name, so you can tell Kevin's truck from Torris's truck at a glance.

The system uses geofencing to automatically detect when a driver arrives at the shipper or receiver. Within 100 meters of the locationâ€”boomâ€”automatic timestamp. When they leave? Another timestamp.

Why does this matter? Detention billing disputes. 

A customer says your driver arrived at 2 PM? You've got GPS proof showing 10:47 AM. Third-party verified coordinates with accuracy down to 3 meters. That's legally defensible.

The map also shows weather conditions at each truck's location and nearby diesel fuel stations. Real-time information your drivers and dispatchers can actually use.

---

**Complete Load Management**

Create a load, assign it to a driver, track it from pickup to deliveryâ€”all in one place.

Support for multiple stops? Check. Complex routing? Check. 

The system automatically calculates mileage using commercial truck routing from HERE Mapsâ€”not car routes that take you under low bridges.

You can use 109 numbers, trip numbers, BOL numbersâ€”whatever numbering system works for your operation. It's flexible.

As drivers move through their route, status updates in real-time. You see "En Route to Pickup," "At Shipper," "Left Shipper," "In Transit," "At Receiver," "Delivered." Every stage tracked.

---

**Driver Mobile Portal**

Your drivers aren't sitting at desks. They're on the road. So we built the interface for phones.

Big buttons. Simple screens. Everything they need, nothing they don't.

They can activate GPS tracking with one tap. Upload proof-of-delivery photos straight from their phone camera. Sign documents digitally. See their route on a map.

When they upload a POD, it goes straight to cloud storageâ€”secure, backed up, accessible from the office instantly.

No more "I'll get you that paperwork when I'm back at the yard next week." It's uploaded before they leave the customer's lot.

---

**Automated Invoicing**

Here's where it gets good.

When a load is marked delivered, LoadTracker Pro can automatically generate an invoice.

It pulls in all the details: base rate, detention time with GPS-stamped proof, lumper fees, fuel surcharges, everything.

No more spending hours at month-end trying to remember what happened on load number 47 back on the 12th.

The system tracks payment status too. You can see which invoices are paid, which are pending, which are overdueâ€”all at a glance.

---

**Smart Document Management**

Rate confirmations. Bills of lading. Proof of delivery. Fuel receipts. 

Every trucking company drowns in paperwork.

LoadTracker Pro handles it with Google Cloud Storageâ€”secure, backed up, accessible anywhere.

But here's the killer feature: OCR.

Upload a rate confirmation PDF. The system reads it automatically. No typing. It pulls out the load details, rates, pickup and delivery locationsâ€”all extracted automatically using Google's Document AI.

Same with BOL numbers. Take a picture of the BOL, upload it, and the system validates it.

That's hours of data entry eliminated.

---

**IFTA Reporting Made Easy**

Every quarter, you need IFTA reports. Every quarter, it's a pain.

LoadTracker Pro tracks mileage automatically. As trucks move, the system logs which states they're traveling through using GPS coordinates.

At quarter-end, you get a ready-to-file report with state-by-state mileage breakdown.

Even when a driver is returning empty to the terminal, they can track IFTA miles. The system calculates the route and breaks it down by state.

Odometer readings, GPS validation, everything you need to file confidently.

---

**Driver Pay Management**

Different drivers, different pay structures. Some get percentage of the load. Some get per-mile rates.

LoadTracker Pro handles both.

When you generate an invoice, the system automatically calculates what the driver earned based on their pay structure.

You can track direct deposit information, pay history, everything in one place.

No more manual spreadsheets trying to figure out who gets paid what.

---

**Fleet and Driver Records**

Keep complete driver profiles: license numbers, medical card expiration dates, employment dates, direct deposit info.

Get alerts when a medical card is about to expire. Stay on top of compliance without Post-It notes on the wall.

Track your trucks too: VIN numbers, odometer readings, service history, maintenance schedules.

The system can alert you when a truck is due for service based on mileage. Preventive maintenance before something breaks on the road.

---

**Accounts Receivable Aging**

Who owes you money? How long have they owed it?

The aging report breaks it down:
- 0 to 30 days
- 31 to 60 days  
- 61 to 90 days
- Over 90 days

Color-coded so you can spot problems at a glance. Red means someone's way overdue.

Customer-level breakdown shows which customers pay on time and which ones you need to chase.

No more digging through spreadsheets wondering where your cash flow went.

---

**Historical Marker Road Tours (Bonus Feature)**

This one's just cool.

We integrated a database of over 222,000 historical markers across the country.

As your driver passes near one, the system automatically triggers an audio narration about that piece of history.

Keeps drivers engaged on long hauls. Educational. Interesting. 

They can choose a male or female AI voice. The system caches the audio in the cloud so it loads fast.

It's not essential to running your business, but your drivers will love it.

---

### **Built Different**

Let me recap what makes this different from the big expensive systems:

**Unlimited Seats** - Your whole office works together. No extra charges for adding users. Three dispatchers? Ten? Doesn't matter. One price.

**Real GPS Tracking** - Not "last known location from hours ago." Real-time positions updated every 30 seconds with automatic arrival and departure detection.

**OCR Document Processing** - Upload a rate con, we read it. Upload a BOL, we validate it. No manual typing.

**Mobile-First Design** - Your drivers can actually use it. Built for phones, works great on desktop too.

**Transparent Usage Dashboard** - See your usage versus your free tier limits in real-time. You always know exactly where you stand. No surprises at month-end.

**One Price** - $249 per month. That's it. No hidden fees, no per-seat charges, no "contact sales for enterprise pricing."

Whether you've got 5 trucks running local 250-mile runs or 15 trucks running coast-to-coast, you pay the same flat rate.

Some companies will stay well under the free tier limits. Others will use more and see overages. But you'll always know because the usage dashboard is right there showing you real-time consumption.

---

### **The Bottom Line**

LoadTracker Pro gives you everything the $700 systems doâ€”GPS tracking, automated invoicing, document management, IFTA reporting, driver managementâ€”for $249 per month with unlimited users.

No forced feature bundles. No surprise billing. No paying for stuff you don't need.

Just honest, transparent software built by someone who actually runs trucks and understands your pain.
